\title{Model phenology from database}
\usage{
devRateIBMdataBase(tempTS, timeStepTS, eq, species, lifeStages, numInd = 10,
  stocha, timeLayEggs = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{tempTS}{The temperature time series (a vector).}

\item{timeStepTS}{The time step of the temperature time series (a numeric with 1 = one day).}

\item{eq}{The name of the equation (e.g., lactin2_95).}

\item{species}{The species for the model (e.g., "Sesamia nonagrioides").}

\item{lifeStages}{The life stages available for the species and the model.}

\item{numInd}{The number of individuals for the simulation (an integer).}

\item{stocha}{The standard deviation of a Normal distribution centered on
develomental rate to create stochasticity among individuals (a numeric).}

\item{timeLayEggs}{The delay between emergence of adults and the time where
females lay eggs in time steps (a numeric).}
}
\value{
A list with three elements: the table of phenology for each individual,
   the models used (nls objects), and the time series for temperature.
