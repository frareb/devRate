\title{Jallow and Matsumura linear thermal performance curve for the
  development performance curve of Helicoverpa armigera}
\usage{
ha_jallow2001(plotfig = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{plotfig}{A Boolean used to return the experimental points and the
equation fitted in the article.}
}
\value{
A list with the equation used, and a list of fitted models for the
  different life stages considered in the article. Each element of the
  list of models is an object of class nls.
}
\description{
Linear development performance curve for eggs, larvae and
  pupae from nine experimental temperatures (10, 13.3, 16.4, 20, 22.5, 25,
  27.9, 30.5, and 32.5 degrees Celsius).
