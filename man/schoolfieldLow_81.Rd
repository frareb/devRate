Equation:
\deqn{rT = \frac{p25 * \frac{T + 273.16}{298} * e^{\frac{aa}{1.987} * (\frac{1}{298} - \frac{1}{T + 273.16})}}{1 + e^{\frac{bb}{1.987} * (\frac{1}{cc} - \frac{1}{T + 273.16})}}}{%
      rT = (p25 * (T + 273.16)/298 * exp(aa/1.987 * (1/298 - 1/(T + 273.16)))) / (1 + exp(bb/1.987 * (1/cc - 1/(T + 273.16))))}

where rT is the development rate, T the temperature, p25 the development
rate at 25 degrees Celcius assuming no enzyme inactivation, aa the enthalpy of
activation of the reaction that is catalyzed by the enzyme, bb the change in
enthalpy associated with low temperature inactivation of the enzyme, cc the
the temperature at which the enzyme is 1/2 active and 1/2 low temperature inactive,
dd the cange in enthalpy associated with high temperature inactivation of the enzyme,
and ee the temperature at which the enzyme is 1/2 active and 1/2 high temperature
inactive.
