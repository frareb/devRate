\details{
Equation:
\deqn{rT = cc * (1 - e^{-k1 * (T - T1)}) * (1 - e^{k2 * (T - T2)})}{%
      rT = cc * (1 - exp(-k1 * (T - T1))) * (1 - exp(k2 * (T - T2)))}

where rT is the development rate, T the temperature, T1 and T2 the conceptual
lower and upper developmental thresholds at which development rates equal zero,
and cc k1, and k2 constants.
