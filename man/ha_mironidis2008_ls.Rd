\title{Mironidis and Savopoulou-Soultani linear thermal performance curve for the
  development performance curve of Helicoverpa armigera}
\usage{
ha_mironidis2008_ls(plotfig = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{plotfig}{A Boolean used to return the experimental points and the
equation fitted in the article.}
}
\value{
A list with the equation used, and a list of fitted models for the
  different life stages considered in the article. Each element of the
  list of models is an object of class nls.
}
\description{
Linear development performance curve for eggs, larvae and
  pupae from twelve experimental temperatures (10, 12.5, 15, 17.5, 20,
  25, 27.5, 30, 32.5, 35, 37.5, and 40 degrees Celsius).
