\details{
Equation:
\deqn{rT = (cc * (T - T1) * (1 - e^{k * (T - T2)}))^2}{%
      rT = (cc * (T - T1) * (1 - exp(k * (T - T2))))^2}

where rT is the development rate, T the temperature, T1 and T2 the minimum
and maximum temperatures at which rate of growth is zero, cc the slope of the
regression as in the rootsq_82 equation, and k a constant. The Ratkowsky model designed
for microorganisms has been modified by Shi et al. 2016 to describe the temperature-dependent
development rates of insects.
