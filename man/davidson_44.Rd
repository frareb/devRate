Equation:
\deqn{rT = \frac{K}{1 + e^{aa + bb * T}}}{%
      rT = K / (1 + exp(aa + bb * T))}

where rT is the development rate, T the temperature, K the distance between
the upper and lower asymptote of the curve, aa the relative position of the origin of
the curve on the abscissa, bb the degree of acceleration of development of the life stage
in relation to temperature.
