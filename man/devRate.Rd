\section{Overview}{


The devRate package provides three categories of functions:

- to find development rate information about a specific organism (Order, Family, Genus, species): which equations were used and what are the associated parameters (e.g., helpful to estimate starting values for your empirical data sets);

- to relate development rate and temperature; and

- to plot your empirical datasets and the associated fitted model, and/or to plot development curves from the literature.
}

\section{Usage}{


You can use the package:

- to get development rate curves as a function of temperature for a specific organism (hundred of examples from the literature are included in the package);

- to know which equations exists and which are most used in the literature; and

- to relate development rate with temperature from your empirical data, using the equations from the package database.
