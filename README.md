## Purpose of the package

The devRate package allows quantifying the relationship between
development rate and temperature in ectotherm organisms.

## How to use the package

You can use the package:

1.  to get development rate curves as a function of temperature for a
    specific organism (hundred of examples from the literature are
    included in the package);

2.  to know which equations exists and which are most used in the
    literature; and

3.  to relate development rate with temperature from your empirical
    data, using the equations from the package database.

## Installation instructions

``` r
# from CRAN
install.packages("devRate")

# Or the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("frareb/devRate")
```

## Overview

The devRate package provides three categories of functions:

1.  functions to find development rate information about a specific
    organism (Order, Family, Genus, species)

2.  functions to relate development rate and temperature, and

3.  functions to plot your empirical datasets and the associated fitted
    model, and/or to plot development curves from the literature.
