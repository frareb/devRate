## T. solanivora dataset
Dataset for T. solanivora was retrieved from Crespo-Perez et al.

## Finding models in the literature
Before attempting to fit any model to the empirical data, the devRate function
"devRateFind" search the database for previous articles fitting which models to
the organism, either by Order, Family, or species.

    devRateFind(orderSP = "Lepidoptera")
    devRateFind(familySP = "Gelechiidae")

Then, the "devRateInfo" function provides additional information on these models
and on parameter estimations.

    devRateInfo(eq = taylor_81)

Information from the database can be plotted using the "devRatePlotInfo" function.

    devRatePlotInfo (eq = taylor_81, sortBy = "ordersp",
      ylim = c(0, 0.20), xlim = c(0, 50))

## Fitting models to empirical datasets
The empirical data can be fitted to any model in the database with the
"devRateModel" function and empirical data plotted against the model using the
"devRatePlot" function.

    mEggs <- devRateModel(eq = taylor_81, temp = rawDevEggs[,1], devRate = rawDevEggs[,2],
      startValues = list(Rm = 0.05, Tm = 30, To = 5))
    mLarva <- devRateModel(eq = taylor_81, temp = rawDevLarva[,1], devRate = rawDevLarva[,2],
      startValues = list(Rm = 0.05, Tm = 25, To = 5))
    mPupa <- devRateModel(eq = taylor_81, temp = rawDevPupa[,1], devRate = rawDevPupa[,2],
      startValues = list(Rm = 0.05, Tm = 30, To = 5))

    devRatePlot(eq = taylor_81, nlsDR = mEggs, temp = rawDevEggs[,1], devRate = rawDevEggs[,2],
      pch = 16, ylim = c(0, 0.2))
    devRatePlot(eq = taylor_81, nlsDR = mLarva, temp = rawDevLarva[,1], devRate = rawDevLarva[,2],
      pch = 16, ylim = c(0, 0.2))
    devRatePlot(eq = taylor_81, nlsDR = mPupa, temp = rawDevPupa[,1], devRate = rawDevPupa[,2],
      pch = 16, ylim = c(0, 0.2))

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(data.frame(Stage = c("Eggs", "Larva", "Pupa"), model = rep("Taylor", 3),
  Rm = c(0.1934, 0.06838, 0.0978), Rm_SE = c(0.01781, 0.009473, 0.0087),
  Tm = c(25.3418, 21.40871, 22.0114), Tm_SE = c(0.76013, 0.729058, 0.4556),
  To = c(-6.8939, 5.54497, -4.7515), To_SE = c(0.76853, 0.865261, 0.4715)))

## Forecasting phenologies from empirical temperature
In this example the temperature dataset is built from a Normal distribution of mean
15 and a standard deviation of 1, with a time step of one day. The developmental
models used are those previously fitted with the Taylor model for the three stages.
We assumed that the average time for female adults to lay eggs was of 1 day. We
simulated 500 individuals, with a stochasticity in developmental rate centered on
the developmental rate, with a standard deviation of 0.015 (Normal distribution).

    forecastTsolanivora <- devRateIBM(
      tempTS = rnorm(n = 100, mean = 15, sd = 1),
      timeStepTS = 1,
      models = list(mEggs, mLarva, mPupa),
      numInd = 500,
      stocha = 0.015,
      timeLayEggs = 1)

    devRateIBMPlot(ibm = forecastTsolanivora, typeG = "density")
